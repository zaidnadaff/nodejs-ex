#Builder pattern

so instead of building creating a complex object just at once, we are doing it step by step.
a different approach to solve a problem.
structuring everything and making sure that a function only does what it is supposed to do.
an object building job, if includes testing can lead to cluttering.
it must only create an object where the testing of params is done separately.
